# Hardware Design

This repository contains various electronic project designs created using Altium Designer. Each project has its own folder containing schematic and PCB files.

## Projects

### 1. Flyback Converter
The Flyback converter is a circuit that converts a DC input voltage to another DC voltage using a transformer as the energy storage element. This project includes the Flyback converter design.
